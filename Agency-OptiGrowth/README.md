# Welcome to Your React Project!

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a fantastic tool for setting up React applications quickly.

## Available Scripts

In this project directory, you have access to several scripts:

### `yarn start`

Starts the development server for your app. Access it by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The page will automatically refresh whenever you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `yarn test`

Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details on running tests, [check here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `yarn build`

Creates a production build of your app in the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance, including minification and hashed filenames, making it ready for deployment. Find more information on deployment [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `yarn eject`

**Note: Ejecting is irreversible!**

If you're unsatisfied with the provided configurations and wish to take full control, `eject` is available. It copies all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. From this point, you have complete control but lose the guided features provided by Create React App.

We recommend using the existing feature set, tailored for small to mid-scale deployments. But when you're ready to customize further, `eject` provides that flexibility.
