## How to Play
The objective of Tetris is to clear lines by fitting different shaped tetrominoes together. The game will start with a random tetromino falling from the top of the screen. You can move the tetromino left or right, rotate it, and accelerate its descent as it falls.

Your goal is to complete horizontal lines with no gaps. When a line is complete, it will disappear, and you will earn points. The game continues, and the tetrominoes keep falling at an increasing speed. The game ends when the screen fills up.
